**Note:** This tool works with `GEMINI.md` or Other context file and is triggered by commands starting with `ai-tracker`.

## Core Function

This utility monitors, summarizes, and documents changes in a software project. It analyzes file modifications and appends a categorized summary to `UPDATES.md` at the project root. Then it will also do a commit with relevant message.

## Workflow

1.  Stage changes using `git add`.
2.  Run `ai-tracker update` to generate a summary.
    - The tool uses `git diff` to find staged changes.
    - Diffs are sent to an AI for summarization and categorization.
    - The summary is appended to `UPDATES.md`.
    - the latest update is always at the top of the file.
    - The commit message is generated by the AI based on the summary.
    - ignore spaces, newlines, and other whitespace changes or non-code changes when generating the summary.
    - Note not to use Command subsitution for git commit message to prevent errors like, Error executing tool run_shell_command: Command substitution using $(), <(), or >() is not allowed for security reasons
    - if the UPDATES.md is newly created, add it to git too
## Usage

### Generate or update `UPDATES.md`:

```bash
# Analyze staged changes and write to UPDATES.md
ai-tracker update
```

### Compare against a specific commit or branch:

```bash
# Compare against a specific commit
ai-tracker update --ref <commit-hash>

# Compare against another branch
ai-tracker update --ref <branch-name>
```

## `UPDATES.md` Format

Changes are grouped by date, category, and then file.
